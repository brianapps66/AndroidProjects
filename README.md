# AndroidProjects

Some files from Android apps that I have made. The full projects are not included, just the main parts of the code that I wrote.

MainActivity.java, PickNumbers.java and DisplayMessageActivity.java are from a random number generator app that I made that chooses lottery numbers for you.

MainActivity (2).java is from a "click-the-button" type app that I made. The goal of the game is to tap a button to gain credits, which can then be spent to increase your credits-per-second rate.

FullscreenActivity.java is from a paint app that I made which can be used to draw a symmetrical picture and save it either as an image or as your wallpaper.
